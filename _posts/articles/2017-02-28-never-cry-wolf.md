title: "Never Cry Wolf"
author: "Farley Mowat"
excerpt: "\"the caribou and the wolf are one; for the caribou feeds the wolf but it is the wolf who keeps the caribou strong\""
notes: "A young biologist, Farley Mowat, makes a case for preserving the Arctic Wolf by recounting his field observations. This book had a massive impact on the public perception towards wolves. It's probably good to note that Mowat has admitted to embellishing his accounts and humanizing his wolf subjects. Regardless, it makes for good writing."
