title: "Thoreau's Country: Journey through a Transformed Landscape"
author: "David R. Foster"
excerpt: "\"In Thoreau's descriptions we see a land brimming with activity that is strongly tied to the changes in the environment.\""
notes: "Parsing Thoreau's daily journal entries, Foster paints a picture of what the New England countryside looked like in the mid-18th century. Thoreau describes a landscape laden with human activity. The same New England countryside is now covered with secondary growth forest. My takeaway: there is hope for our suburbs yet!"
