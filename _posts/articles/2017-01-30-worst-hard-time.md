title: "The Worst Hard Time"
author: "Timothy Egan"
notes: Largely through primary accounts, Timothy Egan tells the incredible story of those who weathered the worst environmental disaster in our history. In private, President Roosevelt discussed abandoning the Great American Plains altogether. And what was the cause of all this? Speculation, profligate consumption and myopic public policy. Sounds about right.
