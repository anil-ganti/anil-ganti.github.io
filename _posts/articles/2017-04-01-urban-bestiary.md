title: "Urban Bestiary: Encountering the Everyday Wild"
author: "Lyanda Lynn Haupt"
excerpt: "\"We have entered a time when the continued presence of the big wild, something that ought to be given, is instead a human choice, and one that will demand of us some uneasiness, uncertainty, and even risk.\""
notes: "Nature writing meets the concrete jungle. I wake up to the sound of birds every morning without ever knowing what or how many species I'm hearing. Lynn Haupt certainly makes you first acknowledge and second appreciate the wildlife living amongst us."
