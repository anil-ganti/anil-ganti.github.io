title: "Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed"
author: "Jared Diamond"
notes: Unlike a lot of environmental crisis books, this is not all finger-pointing and doom and gloom. Instead, Diamond systematically develops a framework to understane what role, if any, poor resource management played in the downfall of sophisticated socieities."
excerpt: "\"The law governing mining in the U.S. is still the General Mining Act which provides massive subsidies to mining companies and unlimited use of public lands for dumping mine wastes\""
