<p>I am a PhD student at Duke University in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I work in the <a href="http://people.ee.duke.edu/~jk/">Sensor Array and Multipath Signal Processing lab</a> under the mentorship of <a href="http://ece.duke.edu/faculty/jeffrey-krolik">Dr. Jeffrey Krolik</a>. 

<p>Previously I worked in various capacities in California's energy sector and the clean technology startup space. In this time I recognized the potential value in intelligent environmental management powered by ubiquitous and low-cost monitoring. I am now at Duke's PhD program to develop sensing hardware and algorithms for low-cost and resource-constrained platforms</p>

<p>Currently my research focuses on acoustic imaging, sensor development, and array processing on heterogeneous computing architectures.</p>
